## About Me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona, working under the supervision of Dr. Joshua A. Levine. My research focuses on Data Visualization algorithms processing field data(mainly Vector Fields), with applications across various domains using fluid flow, blood flow, and magnetic field data.

I am particularly interested in obtaining an improved discrete representation, and my current projects involve subdivision of input mesh and extensions to 3D.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my Bachelor's at Central College.
